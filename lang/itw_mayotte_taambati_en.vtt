WEBVTT

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:26.075
Debaa, it is a women dance
it is a religious dance of the women

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:33.404
Let's dance for several periods
and occasions

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:35.716
The name of Allah is pronounced

00:00:35.997 --> 00:00:38.068
The name of Prophet Mohammed

00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:41.995
and his colleagues,
and his parents, his family

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:43.932
and something else

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.974
We have made several countries

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.638
at the level of Sufism festivals

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.614
for example in India

00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:52.928
In Zanzibar, Copenhagen

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.506
in Sweden, Turkey

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.092
in London, in Metropolis too

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:00.974
I sing the Debaa since
the age of 9

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:03.060
at the time the Debaa it was with the men

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:04.724
this is sung by men

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:07.185
Now they have transmitted to women

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:09.467
and we continued the Debaa
until today

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:18.004
Gestures, it comes in the head
We invent

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:19.575
Search

00:01:19.692 --> 00:01:22.060
After...
When we go to rehearsals

00:01:22.428 --> 00:01:26.263
They tell others. I found a gesture. 
We'll see if it's pretty.

00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:29.427
After, everyone, all of us

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:32.130
we do it well

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:34.232
it is balanced so that is
well

00:01:34.287 --> 00:01:36.333
to make everyone happy
and proud

00:01:44.217 --> 00:01:46.420
We pass on to young people
we train young people

00:01:46.483 --> 00:01:48.357
to take over

00:01:48.513 --> 00:01:51.380
It's the sweet rhythm

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.404
Sufism

00:01:55.224 --> 00:01:57.317
between women

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:59.699
This is not a dance of men

00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:04.777
There are Djinns who love the Debaa

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:08.177
There are Djinns who love Arabic
who love Islam

00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:09.966
Who are Islam itself

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:13.747
and when they hear the Debaa

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:17.162
They come to have fun, to dance
the Debaa with us

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:21.028
Djinn is a spirit, it's wind
it's something like that

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.919
In the Quran we say it is
people like us

00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:26.293
but we can not see them

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:28.146
He is in the head until death

00:02:28.302 --> 00:02:30.364
and when you die
it jumps...

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:33.536
he goes to someone else
But he does not die

00:02:33.568 --> 00:02:34.841
The Djinn does not die

00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:36.896
There are good and bad

00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:47.943
I would like to tell people

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:52.349
What to take in hand
our tradition

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:54.583
our culture

00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:56.529
highlight

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:58.310
save it

00:02:58.654 --> 00:03:00.958
and give place

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.536
because a country that has no
traditions, culture

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:08.560
This is not good

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.451
It's like someone who
has no identity

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:14.099
I say.

00:03:14.217 --> 00:03:17.295
preserving our culture and traditions
